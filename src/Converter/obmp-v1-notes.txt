1. parseUpdateMsg() parses everything in a bgp update msg.
    - treat this function as libparsebgp.

2. take parsed data and feed it to different msg type handlers.

3. each handler continues to convert data in the parsed structure.

4. each handler calls a corresponding msg bus producer function to produce a kafka msg.
    - each producer function still needs to modify the data...

5. too many variables need to be modified from the result produced by libparsebgp.
